<p>Thinking about adding a bearded dragon to your family? These unique reptiles are popular pets thanks to their docile nature and fascinating behaviors, but they also require specialized care to thrive. This guide will cover everything you need to know about keeping your bearded dragon happy, healthy, and well-cared for!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-setting-up-the-perfect-enclosure">1.

Setting Up the Perfect Enclosure" title="Direct link to 1. Setting Up the Perfect Enclosure">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are native to the deserts of Australia, so they need a warm, dry environment to mimic their natural habitat. Here’s what you need to create a comfortable enclosure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tank Size</strong>: A single adult bearded dragon needs at least a 40-gallon tank, though a 75-gallon tank is even better for space to roam.</li>
<li><strong>Lighting</strong>: Proper lighting is essential for bearded dragons. They need both UVA and UVB light to regulate their sleep-wake cycle and absorb calcium.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>UVB Light</strong>: Place a UVB tube light across the top of the enclosure, covering about two-thirds of it, and make sure to replace the bulb every six months to keep the UVB levels effective.</li>
<li><strong>Basking Light</strong>: Bearded dragons are cold-blooded, so they need a basking area to regulate their body temperature. Use a heat lamp to create a basking spot of 95-110°F.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Gradient</strong>: Create a temperature gradient in the tank. The cool side should be around 75-85°F, while the warm side should be closer to 95-100°F during the day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-substrate-choices-whats-safe">2. Substrate Choices: What’s Safe?<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/November/11-14__A-Complete-Care-Guide-For-Beginnera/#2-substrate-choices-whats-safe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Substrate Choices: What’s Safe?" title="Direct link to 2. Substrate Choices: What’s Safe?">​</a></h2>
<p>The substrate, or floor covering, you choose for your bearded dragon’s enclosure can impact their health. Here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Choices</strong>: Non-loose materials like reptile carpet, paper towels, or tile are safe and easy to clean.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Loose substrates like sand, wood chips, and gravel, as these can be ingested and cause health issues.</li>
</ul>

Feeding Your Bearded Dragon" title="Direct link to 3. Feeding Your Bearded Dragon">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. Their diet will vary depending on age:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baby Dragons (0-6 months)</strong>: About 80% protein (live insects like crickets or dubia roaches) and 20% vegetables. Feed babies multiple times per day.</li>
<li><strong>Juvenile Dragons (6-12 months)</strong>: A mix of 60% protein and 40% vegetables. They should eat once or twice a day.</li>
<li><strong>Adult Dragons (12+ months)</strong>: About 20% protein and 80% vegetables, fed once a day.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Protein</strong>: Dubia roaches, crickets, and occasionally mealworms (sparingly, as they are high in fat).</li>
<li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Collard greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, bell peppers, and squash.</li>
<li><strong>Fruits (in moderation)</strong>: Apples, berries, and melons can be given as an occasional treat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Always gut-load insects (feed them nutrient-rich foods) before offering them to your dragon. Also, dust protein sources with calcium powder to prevent metabolic bone disease.</p>

Hydration and Bathing" title="Direct link to 4. Hydration and Bathing">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons get most of their hydration from their food, but it’s still important to provide a shallow dish of fresh water in their enclosure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bathing</strong>: Regular baths help with hydration and shedding. Fill a shallow container with lukewarm water and let your dragon soak for about 15-20 minutes once or twice a week.</li>
</ul>

Handling and Socialization" title="Direct link to 5. Handling and Socialization">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are generally calm and tolerant of handling. Here are some tips for safe interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Slowly</strong>: Begin with short handling sessions to build trust. Gently scoop them up from under their belly to avoid startling them.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Calm</strong>: Move slowly and speak softly to keep them relaxed.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Stress</strong>: Be mindful of any signs of stress, like a darkened beard or fast movements. If your dragon seems anxious, give them a break.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bearded dragons require ample space to move around, bask, and explore:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Babies (up to 6 months)</strong>: A 20-gallon tank works initially, but upgrading to a larger tank is a must as they grow quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Juveniles (6-12 months)</strong>: A 40-gallon tank allows them enough room for activity.</li>
<li><strong>Adults (12+ months)</strong>: At least a 75-gallon tank, though 100-gallon tanks are ideal for full-grown dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look for tanks with front-opening doors, as these make it easier to access and clean.</p>

<p>Lighting is crucial for bearded dragons to synthesize vitamin D and process calcium, which prevents metabolic bone disease.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UVB Lighting</strong>: Install a UVB tube light that covers about two-thirds of the tank length. Replace the bulb every 6-12 months to maintain UVB effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Basking Light</strong>: Bearded dragons need a basking area of 95-110°F. Position a heat lamp at one end of the tank to create a warm zone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a temperature gradient in the tank allows your dragon to regulate its body temperature. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basking Zone</strong>: Maintain a temperature of 95-110°F for adult dragons, slightly lower for juveniles.</li>
<li><strong>Cool Side</strong>: The cooler end of the tank should be around 75-85°F.</li>
<li><strong>Night Temperature</strong>: Drop to around 65-75°F at night to mimic desert conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bearded dragons love exploring, hiding, and climbing. Include these in the setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basking Rock or Log</strong>: Dragons need a spot to bask under the heat lamp. Look for a stable, non-slip surface.</li>
<li><strong>Hides</strong>: Place at least one hide in the cooler side of the tank for them to rest and de-stress.</li>
<li><strong>Branches and Climbing Areas</strong>: Add branches or driftwood to encourage exercise and natural behaviors.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Bearded Dragon Close-Up" src="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/assets/images/BD-behaviour-023d4bb6323c7fe84c4dfa0ce7001054.jpg" width="1280" height="853" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Bearded dragons have unique ways of expressing themselves, and understanding their behavior can help you become a more attentive and compassionate pet owner. Knowing how to interpret common signs of contentment, stress, or even illness allows you to respond appropriately and create a comfortable environment for your dragon. Let’s dive into some common behaviors and what they mean.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-head-bobbing-a-sign-of-dominance">1. Head Bobbing: A Sign of Dominance<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-31__understanding-dragon-behaviour/#1-head-bobbing-a-sign-of-dominance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Head Bobbing: A Sign of Dominance" title="Direct link to 1. Head Bobbing: A Sign of Dominance">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the most iconic bearded dragon behaviors is head bobbing. You’ll notice quick, repetitive bobs from your dragon’s head, which can mean a few different things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishing Dominance</strong>: Especially common in males, head bobbing is often a display of dominance over other dragons or even their reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Mating Behavior</strong>: Male dragons bob their heads to impress females during mating seasons.</li>
<li><strong>Stress</strong>: Sometimes, head bobbing can signal stress if your dragon is reacting to unfamiliar surroundings or new tank mates.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your dragon is alone but still bobbing its head, check for reflections or other changes in their environment that might be triggering this behavior.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-arm-waving-a-friendly-greeting-or-submission">2. Arm Waving: A Friendly Greeting or Submission<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-31__understanding-dragon-behaviour/#2-arm-waving-a-friendly-greeting-or-submission" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Arm Waving: A Friendly Greeting or Submission" title="Direct link to 2. Arm Waving: A Friendly Greeting or Submission">​</a></h2>
<p>Arm waving is a gentler movement where the dragon raises one arm and moves it in a circular motion. This behavior usually signals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submission</strong>: In the presence of a dominant dragon or even their reflection, dragons wave their arms as a sign of submission.</li>
<li><strong>Greeting</strong>: Arm waving can also be a friendly gesture, almost like a wave to say “hello” to their owner or another dragon.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your dragon frequently waves, it’s usually not a cause for concern; they’re likely acknowledging their environment or establishing that they’re not a threat.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-beard-puffing-and-color-changes-expressing-mood">3. Beard Puffing and Color Changes: Expressing Mood<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-31__understanding-dragon-behaviour/#3-beard-puffing-and-color-changes-expressing-mood" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Beard Puffing and Color Changes: Expressing Mood" title="Direct link to 3. Beard Puffing and Color Changes: Expressing Mood">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are named for their ability to puff out their beards, which often darken or even turn black. Here’s what beard puffing and color changes could indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive Reaction</strong>: Dragons puff their beards to appear larger and more intimidating, often when they feel threatened.</li>
<li><strong>Discomfort or Aggression</strong>: If they feel stressed or agitated, a dark beard can signal a desire to be left alone.</li>
<li><strong>Male Courtship Display</strong>: Males may puff their beards to impress females during mating.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your dragon’s beard darkens frequently, take a look at their surroundings for potential stressors and monitor them for signs of illness.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-glass-surfing-a-sign-of-boredom-or-anxiety">4. Glass Surfing: A Sign of Boredom or Anxiety<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-31__understanding-dragon-behaviour/#4-glass-surfing-a-sign-of-boredom-or-anxiety" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Glass Surfing: A Sign of Boredom or Anxiety" title="Direct link to 4. Glass Surfing: A Sign of Boredom or Anxiety">​</a></h2>
<p>If you see your dragon pressing its belly against the glass and appearing to “surf” up and down, they may be feeling anxious or bored.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Stress</strong>: Glass surfing often happens when a dragon feels confined or is reacting to reflections or other pets nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Boredom</strong>: Dragons need mental stimulation, so this behavior could signal that they want more enrichment in their enclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider rearranging tank decor, adding climbing structures, or introducing new toys to give them something to explore and reduce boredom.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-tail-twitching-possible-sign-of-stress-or-excitement">5. Tail Twitching: Possible Sign of Stress or Excitement<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-31__understanding-dragon-behaviour/#5-tail-twitching-possible-sign-of-stress-or-excitement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Tail Twitching: Possible Sign of Stress or Excitement" title="Direct link to 5. Tail Twitching: Possible Sign of Stress or Excitement">​</a></h2>
<p>A twitching tail can mean different things based on the context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunting Mode</strong>: When dragons are about to catch prey, they sometimes twitch their tail in excitement.</li>
<li><strong>Stress</strong>: If there’s no prey around, a twitching tail may indicate stress or overstimulation. Monitor your dragon closely to see if anything in their environment could be causing discomfort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-digging-preparing-for-rest-or-laying-eggs">6.

Digging: Preparing for Rest or Laying Eggs" title="Direct link to 6. Digging: Preparing for Rest or Laying Eggs">​</a></h2>
<p>Digging is a natural behavior that bearded dragons exhibit for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comfort</strong>: Sometimes, dragons dig to create a comfortable spot for rest, particularly in cooler parts of the enclosure.</li>
<li><strong>Brumation</strong>: Before entering a state of brumation (a hibernation-like period), dragons might dig to prepare a secure place.</li>
<li><strong>Laying Eggs</strong>: If you have a female dragon, digging can be a sign that she’s ready to lay eggs. Make sure to provide a laying box if she’s exhibiting persistent digging.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7-eye-closing-a-signal-of-contentment-or-mild-discomfort">7.

Eye Closing: A Signal of Contentment or Mild Discomfort" title="Direct link to 7. Eye Closing: A Signal of Contentment or Mild Discomfort">​</a></h2>
<p>You may notice your bearded dragon closing its eyes during interactions or basking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contentment</strong>: Some dragons close their eyes when they feel relaxed and safe, especially while being gently petted.</li>
<li><strong>Irritation</strong>: If your dragon closes its eyes in reaction to something specific (like a bright light), it could signal mild discomfort. Check the lighting setup to ensure it’s not too harsh.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning to understand your dragon’s behavior is a rewarding aspect of pet ownership. By interpreting their body language, you can create a more enriching and comfortable environment that meets their needs. Keep an eye out for significant changes in behavior, as these can sometimes be indicators of health issues.</p>
<p>With a little observation and patience, you’ll develop a strong bond with your bearded dragon, responding to their signals and creating a safe, supportive habitat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Bearded Dragon Eating" src="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/assets/images/BD-FEED-c14ff7fa176614324acbbdff152d0c9e.jpg" width="291" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Providing a nutritious, balanced diet is crucial to keeping your bearded dragon healthy and thriving. As omnivores, bearded dragons require a variety of insects, vegetables, and occasional fruits to meet their nutritional needs. In this guide, we’ll explore age-appropriate diets, a feeding schedule, and tips to ensure your dragon gets all the nutrients they need.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-understanding-bearded-dragon-diets-by-age">1. Understanding Bearded Dragon Diets by Age<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-24__How-to-feed-your-bearded-dragon/#1-understanding-bearded-dragon-diets-by-age" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Understanding Bearded Dragon Diets by Age" title="Direct link to 1. Understanding Bearded Dragon Diets by Age">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons have different nutritional needs at each stage of life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baby Dragons (0-6 months)</strong>: Baby dragons grow quickly and need a diet high in protein to support development. This means about 80% of their diet should be live insects, with the remaining 20% coming from leafy greens and vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Juvenile Dragons (6-12 months)</strong>: Juveniles still require significant protein but can start increasing their intake of vegetables. Aim for a diet of 60% insects and 40% greens.</li>
<li><strong>Adult Dragons (12+ months)</strong>: Adult bearded dragons need more vegetables and a lower amount of protein, with 80% of their diet from greens and 20% from insects.</li>
</ul>
<p>These age-based guidelines are essential for supporting growth in younger dragons and preventing obesity in adults.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-selecting-insects-and-protein-sources">2. Selecting Insects and Protein Sources<a href="https://www.scalestailsandtales.com/2024/October/10-24__How-to-feed-your-bearded-dragon/#2-selecting-insects-and-protein-sources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Selecting Insects and Protein Sources" title="Direct link to 2. Selecting Insects and Protein Sources">​</a></h2>
<p>Protein is a vital part of a bearded dragon’s diet, especially during early life stages. However, not all insects are created equal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dubia Roaches</strong>: High in protein, easy to digest, and lower in fat, dubia roaches are an excellent staple insect.</li>
<li><strong>Crickets</strong>: Widely available and affordable, but they should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious foods) before feeding to your dragon.</li>
<li><strong>Mealworms and Superworms</strong>: These can be given occasionally to adult dragons, but they’re high in fat, so avoid giving them to younger dragons frequently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Always dust insects with calcium powder (with or without vitamin D3, depending on your lighting setup) before feeding to help prevent metabolic bone disease.</p>

<p>Vegetables and leafy greens are crucial to your dragon’s health, providing fiber, vitamins, and hydration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leafy Greens</strong>: Collard greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, and turnip greens are all nutritious staples.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Bell peppers, squash, zucchini, and carrots can be offered as part of a balanced diet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all vegetables are suitable for bearded dragons. Avoid spinach, kale, and iceberg lettuce as they can interfere with calcium absorption or have low nutritional value.</p>

<p>Fruits are high in sugar and should only be offered occasionally:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safe Fruits</strong>: Blueberries, strawberries, apples, and mango are all suitable in small quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Serving Size</strong>: Offer fruit no more than once a week as a small part of their meal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Chop fruits into bite-sized pieces to prevent choking and mix them into their greens to encourage interest.</p>

<p>Following a consistent feeding schedule keeps your bearded dragon on a routine and ensures they get proper nutrition. Here’s a suggested schedule based on age:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baby Dragons (0-6 months)</strong>: Feed live insects 2-3 times daily, and offer greens once daily.</li>
<li><strong>Juvenile Dragons (6-12 months)</strong>: Feed live insects once daily and greens once daily.</li>
<li><strong>Adult Dragons (12+ months)</strong>: Offer greens daily and protein (insects) only 2-3 times per week.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your dragon doesn’t finish their food, remove it after about 15-20 minutes to keep the enclosure clean and prevent overeating.</p>

Hydration Tips" title="Direct link to 6. Hydration Tips">​</a></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons get much of their hydration from their food, but they still need additional water:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water Bowl</strong>: Place a shallow dish of fresh water in their enclosure, refreshed daily.</li>
<li><strong>Misting</strong>: Lightly mist greens with water before serving to add extra hydration.</li>
<li><strong>Bathing</strong>: Offer a shallow, lukewarm bath once or twice a week for hydration and shedding.</li>

<p>A healthy dragon has a good appetite and shows interest in food. Changes in behavior or appetite can indicate health issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signs of Health</strong>: Bright eyes, active behavior, and regular eating.</li>
<li><strong>Signs of Illness</strong>: Loss of appetite, lethargy, swollen joints, or weight loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice any concerning signs, consult a reptile veterinarian to ensure your dragon’s health.</p>
